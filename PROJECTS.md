IME Projects
============

+ Reimplement IME paper
+ IMEter improved
+ IME in C. elegans and D. melanogaster
+ IME in fungi
+ IME motif finder
+ IME BLAST
+ IME conservation

## Reimplement IME paper ##

+ Make an IMEter using the exact same procedures as the original paper
+ Fiind motifs in high scoring introns


## IMEter Improved ##

+ Signal decay models
+ Sliding window
+ HMM - using stuff from the #algorithm sub-group


## IME in C. elegans and D. melanogaster ##

+ Try using same procedures as A. thaliana
+ Try different procedures
+ Find motifs


## IME in fungi ##

+ Download fungal genomes and put them in datacore
+ Continue with "the usual" methods


## IME motif finder ##

+ Recreate the MEME probability models (OOPS, ZOOPS, ANR)
+ Create a better probability model that fits IME signals
+ Create an algorithm for finding motifs
	+ Gibbs sampling?
	+ Genetic algorithm?
	+ Enumerative digitalized motifs?

## IME BLAST ##

+ USE BLASTN with specialized parameters to find conserved IME signals
+ Plants first
+ Other things...


## IME conservation ##

+ Evolution of IME signals in plants
+ Other organisms...
